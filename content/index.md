# Who am I?

I'm an engineer with 6+ years building AI systems for large-scale imagery data from data-engineering to product
integration in biomedical, remote sensing, and climate.

# Timeline

I graduated from the Engineering Science program at University of Toronto with a specialization in physics.

### Chipcare: 2018-2019

After graduation I joined Chipcare, a biomedical device company developing a tabletop diagnostic device that runs just about any assay in 30 mins at the doctor's office, as an optical engineer.

I started making hardware designs for efficient and uniform laser illumination and microscopic fluorescent video-imaging. Then I added computer vision (CV) to my role, and developed a near-realtime CV pipeline for the microscopic flow data, including detection, tracking, and diagnostic classification using ML.

### Pharos: 2020-2023

I left Chipcare to travel, which was interrupted by the covid pandemic. Then I co-founded [Pharos Platforms](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pharosplatforms/posts/?feedView=images), a company bringing climate/weather geodata to infrastructure stakeholders. I worked as CTO.

We raised a pre-seed and started by developing short and long-term forecasts for flooding and waterflow based on sensor fusion of rivergauge, weather, and climate model data. We had a few projects, but didn't succeed in finding a repeatable product in that market.

> During this time, I worked part-time as a consultant for UNC/Codetta Bio (multiplexed biomarker measurements) and built the end-to-end CV pipeline for their microarray digital/qPCR device.

At Pharos, we next applied climate and weather data to agriculture. Using TBs of climate simulations, we developed a generative ML model for temp/precip distributions to evaluate opportunities to change which crops could be grown and systemic risks. We had some traction here, but failed to raise a seed round.

Finally, we pivoted to delivering data-engineering services to engineering/data science teams in infrastructure. I built a cloud data-engineering system that provided realtime access to slices of TBs of high-res weather/climate geodata. However, at this point, we had long run out of money, and had to shut the company.

### streambatch: 2023-2024

I co-founded another company, [streambatch](https://www.streambatch.io/), to provide simple, tabular API access to daily 10m timeseries plant growth data anywhere on the globe for agriculture, forestry, and infrastructure. To do this, I built another cloud data-engineering system for batch processing of PBs of satellite data. Then I designed an ML data fusion algorithm which combined multiple satellite constellations at different resolutions to produce a maximum-coverage data product.

streambatch continues to provide enterprise customers with high-quality near-realtime fused NDVI data.

> Most recently I consulted for Proteowise, a biotech company making high-throughput proteomics devices, where I built an ML CV system for electrophoresis imagery classification & quantification.
